# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to our **Movie Recommendation System** project! This repository focuses on building a scalable machine learning model that predicts user preferences and recommends movies based on historical ratings and movie metadata. Our ultimate goal is to create a system that mirrors the personalized recommendation engines used by platforms like Netflix, HBO, and Hulu.

## Project Overview
Our final project aims to solve the problem of predicting customer behavior or recommending personalized products/services in the entertainment domain. The ability to deliver targeted recommendations is crucial in today’s marketplace, as it enhances decision-making, improves customer satisfaction, and drives revenue.

We’re exploring various recommendation techniques (collaborative filtering, content-based, hybrid methods) to provide personalized results for end users. Although we haven’t finalized which models or algorithms we’ll integrate, we’re experimenting with a broad range of approaches to understand which yields the best performance for our data.

**Why is this important?**  
Personalized recommendations are the backbone of many online platforms; they help users navigate overwhelming volumes of content. By leveraging machine learning and domain-specific metadata, businesses can increase user engagement and retention.

## Dataset
We are using [The Movie Database (TMDb) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)* to gain deeper insights into a variety of movie features, including:
- Movie titles & release dates  
- Genres & keywords  
- Cast & crew information  
- User ratings (through files like `ratings.csv`, `ratings_small.csv`)  
- Budget, revenue, and more  

We plan to enhance this dataset over time to incorporate additional information where beneficial (e.g., director/actor data, textual overviews, etc.). In a live production environment, data would continuously update as new user interactions come in.

*\(Ensure you have access to Kaggle and respect all licensing agreements when using the dataset.\)

## Project Objectives
1. **Build a Personalized Recommendation Engine**  
   - Predict user tastes using historical ratings and item (movie) metadata.
2. **Explore Different Recommender Approaches**  
   - Evaluate collaborative filtering, content-based, and hybrid recommendation methods.
3. **Deliver a Scalable Solution**  
   - Ensure our model can adapt to large datasets and changing user data in real time.
4. **Integrate Real-World Workflow**  
   - Use Jira for project management and issue tracking.
   - Potentially create an application interface where end users can receive dynamic recommendations.

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
   cd Movie-Recommendation-System
   ```
2. **Create a Python virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # (Mac/Linux)
   venv\Scripts\activate     # (Windows)
   ```
3. **Install project dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Download and place the TMDb dataset**  
   - Download `TheMovieDataset.zip` from Kaggle (see the link above).
   - Extract or place it into a suitable directory (e.g., `data/`), making sure your code paths match.

## Roadmap
- **Data Cleaning & Parsing**  
  - Parse JSON-like fields (genres, cast, crew, keywords), handle missing values, ensure consistent ID references.
- **EDA & Feature Engineering**  
  - Explore distributions of ratings, extract features from textual data, transform or encode cast/crew.
- **Model Prototyping**  
  - Implement baseline collaborative filtering (e.g., matrix factorization).  
  - Investigate content-based approaches leveraging metadata (e.g., TF-IDF, embeddings).  
  - Potentially combine both in a hybrid system.
- **Evaluation & Refinement**  
  - Use standard metrics like RMSE (for rating predictions), mean average precision (for ranked lists), etc.  
  - Optimize hyperparameters, scale to full dataset.
- **Interactive Deployment** (stretch goal)  
  - Wrap the best model into an application (web or otherwise) to serve recommendations in real time.

We also track these milestones, tasks, and issues using **Jira** for project management. This ensures transparency, clear ownership, and timely progress updates for each segment of the project.
